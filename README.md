# User Manager

This repository contains a simple demo API built with NodeJS.
The API is used to manage users in a MongoDB database.

### Development
This application was developed using [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/). MongoDB was used for persisting data with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping).

### Running the Containers
* Make sure you have docker running on your system. The containers are linux based so make the relevant changes to your docker host settings if necessary.
* Ensure that you've `node` installed on your PC.
* Clone the repository by entering the command `git clone https://github.com/joeizang/UserManagerDocker.git` in the terminal.
* Navigate to the project folder using `cd UserManager` on your terminal (or command prompt)
* After cloning, install the application's dependencies with the command `npm install`.

* After this, you can then start the server with the command: `npm start`.

### Testing
To ensure that your installation is successful you'll need to run tests.
The command: `npm test` makes this possible. It isn't functional right now, but once it's done you'll be notified via the README.

### API Documentation
The API only has one endpoint which is the `/users` endpoint for saving users to the database. The endpoint works with the HTTP verbs: `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.
